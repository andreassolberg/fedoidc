    <abstract>
      <t>The OpenID Connect standard specifies how a Relying Party (RP) can
      discover metadata about an OpenID Provider (OP), and then register to
      obtain relying party credentials. The discovery and registration process
      does not involve any mechanisms of dynamically establishing trust in the
      exchanged information, but instead rely on-out-of band trust
      establishment.</t>

      <t>In an identity federation context, this is not sufficient. The
      participants of the federation must be able to trust information
      provided about other participants in the federation. OpenID Connect
      Federations specifies how trust can be dynamically obtained from
      resolving trust from a common trusted third party.</t>

      <t>While this specification is primarily targeting OpenID Connect, it is
      designed in order to allow for re-use by other protocols and in other
      use cases.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification describes how two entities that would like to
      interact can dynamically fetch and and resolve trust and metadata for a
      given protocol, by the use of third party trust issuers.</t>

      <t>An identity federation can be realized using this specification by
      the use of one or more levels of trust issuers. A trust issuer is an
      entity, which main purpose is to issue trust statements about entities,
      such as OpenID relying party and providers. This specification does not
      mandates a specific way or restrict how a federation may be built.
      Instead the specification provides the basic technical trust
      infrastructure building blocks needed to build a a dynamic and
      distributed trust network such as a federation.</t>

      <t>An entity will typically configure a local trust root to include the
      identifier and the certificate of a the trusted third party &ndash; the
      federation. All entities involved in OpenID Connect Federation,
      including the trust issuers, will have their own unique identifier. This
      identifier is used to dynamically fetch entity statements. As a complete
      chain of entity statements is obtained, connecting the local trust root
      to the target entity, the entity may resolve the resulting trusted
      metadata, by flattening the metadata found in the trust chain.</t>

      <t>Note that a real-world entity like an organisation, a company may be
      represented by more than one entity in a federation.</t>

      <t>The OpenID Connect Federation trust chains are relying on
      cryptographically signed JWT documents, and the trust chain does not at
      all rely on TLS in order to establish trust.</t>

      <t>OpenID Connect Federation may very well be used for other purposes
      than building traditional identity federations. One of them could be to
      build an OpenID Connect deployment where the key rollover process does
      not fall back to TLS. Another could be allowing traditionally
      public/native clients, such as medical devices, to generate its own key
      pair, and use asymmetric crypto to increase the overall security.</t>

    <section anchor="entity-statement" title="Entity Statement ">
      <t>An entity statement is always a signed JWT. An entity statement is
      issued by the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx>, and the statement
      considers the subject entity, the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>. To be
      able to resolve trust and metadata, one need to know the identifier of
      the target entity &ndash; we refer to this as the leaf entity. The leaf
      entity will always sign a statement about itself, and give some hints to
      other entities that may want to issue statements about itself. All other
      entities in a trust chain we refer to as intermediate entities. The
      local configured trust root, we refer to as the trust anchor.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="iss">REQUIRED. The entity identifier of the entity that
          issues the statement. If the iss and the sub is identical, the
          issuer is making a statement about itself.</t>

          <t hangText="jwks">REQUIRED. A <xref target="RFC7517">JSON Web Key

          entity's signing keys.<vspace blankLines="1"/>These keys is used
          verify the identity of the subject. A corresponding private key is
          used by the leaf entity to sign an entity statement about itself,
          and intermediate entities to sign statements about other entities.
          The keys that can be found here is primarily intended to sign entity
          statements, and can not be used in other protocols, unless the
          metadata type specification explicitly states how the keys can be
          used. In OpenID Connect, the jwks keys cannot be used within the
          Authorization/AccessToken/RefreshToken/UserInfo requests and
          responses. Instead OpenID Connect specific metadata includes claims
          for this purpose.</t>

          <t hangText="metadata">REQUIRED. JSON object including protocol
          specific metadata claims that represent the leaf node. To resolve

          keys of the JSON object represent the metadata type identifier, and
          the value MUST be a JSON object representing the metadata according
          to the metadata scema of that metadata type. To allow for the leaf
          node to resolve a specific metadata type, all intermediate entities
          in the trust chain MUST contain a metadata document for this
          specific type. See <xref target="metadata">section about

      <section title="The trust anchor">
        <t>In order to configure trust when deploying a software component, it
        is recommended to align the configuration with the semantics of a
        entity statement. How the configuration is stored and the exact format
        is out of the scope of this specification, but it is recommended to
        allow the user to configure a list of entries containing <spanx
        style="verb">sub</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> and <spanx
        style="verb">metadata</spanx>. When the compound metadata from the
        trust chain is resolved, metadata from the local trust root can be
        applied in the <xref target="flattening-metadata">metadata flattening
        process</xref>. This allows the configuration of a provider to put
        trust limitations applied to all metadata resolved for the various
        trust roots. For example, a provider may trust a large federation with
        a metadata limitation of only releasing the name and userid, and no
        other scopes or claims. The provider may add other trust roots with a
        more limited target group to allow for more scopes and claims.</t>

      <t>In order to fetch entity statements, you need to know the identifier

      statements before you initiate contact with another entity, where the
      identifier of this entity is all the information you have. Then you will
      ask this identifier for entity statements about itself.</t>

      <t>Fetching entity statements is performed in two steps. First WebFinger
      is used to resolve the entity statement API endpoint of the entity to
      ask. Then the API endpoint is used to fetch one or more entity
      statements.</t>

        self issued entity statement of the remote peer.</t>

        <t>We refer to the locally configured trust root as ES0, the top level
        intermediate entity statement as ES1, up to the self signed entity
        statement ESi. A trust chain without any intermediate entities is also
        valid. The trust anchor might include a ES0 representing a direct
        trust to a remote peer, and the self issued statement of the peer will
        then be ES1.</t>

        <t>To validate the chain, the signed JWT ES1 is validated against the
        public signing keys in ES0, jwks. Next, the signed JWT ES2 is
        validated against the public signing keys in ES1, and so on until the
        complete chain is validated.</t>

    <section title="OpenID Connect Communication">
      <t>The section describes how the trust framework in this specification
      is used to establish trust between an OpenID Relying Party and an OpenID
      Provider that has no explicit configuration or registration in advance.
      The use of OpenID Connect Federation enables dynamically building large
      scale multi-lateral federations.</t>

      <t>There is two alternative approaches to establish trust between a
      Relying Party and a Provider. Members of a federation or a community
      should agree upon which approach to use. While implementations should
      support both methods, deployments may choose to disable the use of one
      of them.</t>

      <section title="Explicit Registration">
        <t>This method involves performing an explicit registration of a new
        client the first time a Relying Party interacts with an OpenID
        Provider using something akin to <xref
        target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
        Registration 1.0</xref>.</t>

        <t>It is assumed that an federation entity has a set of authorityHints
        and knowledge about which trust anchor that can be found at the end of
        a trust chain starting in each authorityHint. How the entity has
        received this knowledge is outside the scope of this document.</t>

        <section title="Provider Discovery">
          <t>The RP will start by figuring out the OPs metadata using the
          process specified in <xref target="resolving_trust">Resolving trust
          chain and metadata </xref> above.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Clireg" title="Client Registration">
          <section anchor="Cliregreq" title="Client Registration Request">
            <t>The OP MUST support dynamic relying party registration. That it
            does so is signaled by have the claim <spanx style="verb">federation_registration_endpoint
              </spanx> in the metadata.</t>

            <t>Given that the OP supports dynamic registration the RP
            progresses as follows: <list style="numbers">
                <t>Once it has the list of acceptable trust chains for the OP
                it MUST choose the subset it wants to progress with. The
                subset can be as small as one trust chain but it can also
                contain more then one.</t>

                <t>Based on the trust anchors referenced in the subset of
                trust chains, the RP will choose a set of authorityHints from
                its own set that terminates in those trust anchors.</t>

                <t>The RP will now construct a self-signed entity statement
                where the metadata statement chosen is influence by the OPs
                metadata and the authorityHints specified are picked by the
                process described above.</t>

                <t>The entity statement is sent to the <spanx style="verb">federation_registration_endpoint
                  </spanx> defined in this document.</t>
              </list></t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="cliregresp" title="Client Registration Response">
            <t>Now on the OPs side the following occurs: <list style="number">
                <t>It receives the request, collects and evaluates the trust
                chains starting with the authorityHints in the registration
                request. After having verified such chains it can verify that
                the signature on the received registration request is
                correct.</t>

                <t>If it finds more then one acceptable trust chain it MUST
                chose one or more that terminates in one and the same trust
                anchor.</t>

                <t>At this point, if there already exists a client
                registration under the same entity_id then that registration
                MUST be regarded as invalid.</t>

                <t>The OP will now construct an entity statement containing a
                description of the RPs metadata that the OP finds acceptable.
                To the entity statement it will add one or more
                authorityHints, from its collection, that terminates in the
                trust anchor chosen above.</t>

                <t>It will sign and return the signed entity statement to the
                RP</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Back at the RP it will: <list style="number">

                authorityHints terminates in trust anchors that where
                referenced in the entity statement it sent to the OP.</t>

                <t>If the RP is OK with the metadata that was the result of
                the flattening of the received entity statement then it store
                the configuration and can continue communicating with the OP
                using the agreed on metadata.</t>

                <t>If the RP was not OK, for some reason, with the received
                entity statement then it has the choice to restart the
                registration process or to give up.</t>

        <section title="After client registration">
          <t>A client registration using this specification is not expected to
          be valid for ever. The entity statements exchanged all have
          expiration times. Which means that the registration will eventually
          time out. An OP can also for some reason decided that a client
          registration is not valid anymore. To this can be added that the
          entities in the federation, for a number of reasons, over time may
          change how fast their signature will expires, thereby increasing or
          decreasing the lifetime of a trust chain.</t>

          <section title="What the RP MUST do">
            <t>At regular intervals the RP MUST: <list style="number">
                <t>Starting with the OPs entity statement, resolve and verify
                the trust chains it chose to use when constructing the

                anymore or do not verify, then the registration should be

        to choose from is another.</t>

      <section title="Resolving the provider trust chain">
        <t>In order to establish trust with this provider, the Foodle service
        provider would need to fetch sufficient entity statements to represent
        a complete chain from the self issued statement to the locally
        configured trust root, which contain SWAMID.</t>

        <t>The information found in the authorityHints is critical in order to
        dynamically discover the trust chain. If such hints are not present,
        the relying party may resume to fixed configured trust roots to ask
        for trust statements.</t>

        <t>In this example, Foodle now fetches an entity statement from
        SWAMID. First a WebFinger request to obtain the metadata endpoint:</t>
